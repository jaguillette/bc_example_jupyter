batch_connect:
  template: "basic"

  # This configuration was suggested by Jianjun as a fix for the connection issue:
  set_host: "host=$(hostname | awk '{print $1}').<%= cluster%>.pcluster"
  # It's not in the documentation for clusters, it's in the documentation for submit.yml:
  # https://osc.github.io/ood-documentation/latest/how-tos/app-development/interactive/submit.html
  # It's possible to set any of these batch connect options for a cluster from that cluster's config file
  # However, I don't know how to change that in the IAC, since I think that cluster config file is generated somewhere else. Maybe it's in the s3 for persistence, and I can change it there? but then that makes it hard to reproduce.
